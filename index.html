    <h1>Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course Tutorial</h1>
    <h4>Summary of introduction 0:23:00</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 - Decentralized/li>
        <li>2 - Transparency</li>
        <li>3 - Quick and efficient</li>
        <li>4 - Immutable and secure</li>
        <li>5 - Remove counterparty risk</li>
        <li>6 - Allow for trust minimized agreements</li>
        <li>7 - Hybrid smart contracts on and off-chain</li>
        <li>Decentralised autonomous organisations (or corporations)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bolckchain transaction </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ethrerum wallet from Metamask. Provide password (called Metamask password) and reveal secret words (seedphrase) provided</li>
        <li>Secret phrase (mnemonic) used to access Account address 0x(plus 40 alphanumerics)</li>
        <li>(Etherscan uses the account address to view - publicly - transactions)</li>
        <li>0:30:40 Multiple addresses can be created on one mnemonic</li>
        <li>Each of the multiple accounts created can be accessed by that (one) mnemonic</li>
        <li>Each account created (on one mnemonic) has different Account address (public key) but each also has it's own private key (unique identifier).</li>
        <li>Click on Etherum  Mainnet - you are on it! On this dropdown you can access Testnetworks to check your code.</li>
        <li>To 0:32:10</li>
        <li>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) help relieve transaction fees.</li>
        <li>Trial transaction on Rinkeby authenticated Faucet testnet, using Faucet which provides free tokens </li>
        <li>Block Explorer can be used to view details of transaction</li>
        <li>There is a transaction fee and a Gas fee</li>
        <li>Gas - the fee paid to nodes for the value of the transaction computation</li>
        <li>Gas units can be reckoned in Gwei ie. Gas units x Gwei = total Gwei for Gas (1 Gwei = 10 -9 Ethers)</li>
        <li>User specified increase of Gas may give preferencial treatment (faster) for transaction.</li>
        <li>Gas price is shown in transaction window</li>
        <li>Transaction shown in your account!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0:43:32 Fundementals of Blockchain with Blockchain Demo! </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Using https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/</li>
        <li>In a numbered Block:</li>
        <li>An SHA265 Hash is: a fixed length string - identifying a piece of data - when data is in the string  you have - a Hash Function</li>
        <li>Extended to a Block will have a Block No., Nonce, Data and Hash plus a 'Mine' button.</li>
        <li>Clicking on 'Mine' button creates 0000 at start of Hash No. indicating the block is 'Signed'</li>
        <li>Mining problem: find Nonce value to start Hash No. with 0000. It is done by (computerised) guesswork. </li>
       
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>0:49:48 A Block in a Block Chain:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Genesis block is first block in the chain. (And has zeros for Previous, see next line)</li>
        <li>The blocks in a chain have a 'Previous' input window added which shows the hash of the previous block.</li>
        <li>Attempting to change data in a block invalidates all subsequent blocks.</li>
        <li>Re-mining will re-validate the block but will show a different hash and blocks on other computers (Peer views) will show the original hash indicating a change!</li>
        <li>Out of step hashes show a change in the block from the original. The offending chain of blocks will be excluded.</li>
        <li>By adding a Coinbase input window for transactions, previous blocks will indicate funds available and provenance.</li>
        <li>Nonce (again!) 1 - a number found once to solve the 0000 hash algorithm and 2 - the number used to define the transaction for an account address.</li>
        <li>to 1:01:30</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Public / Private Keys and Signing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the origin of a transaction</li>
        <li>Etherium and bitcoin use an Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</li>
        <li>Signature windows are added to the block with Public / Private Key Pair and Message.</li>
        <li>A private key is randomly created, followed by the automatically generated public key.</li>
        <li>Click on 'Signatures' to show Message, Private Key and Message signature windows.</li>
        <li>Then create message, enter private key and a message signature is created and which can be verified with the pub;lic key.</li>
        <li>So... I send a transaction from my address to another address, add my private key, then 'sign' to create a message signature. </li>
        <li>By-the-way, an account address is a derivitave of your public key</li>
        <li>Private key in Hexadecimal used for Brownie. It is a Python-based development and testing 
            framework for smart contracts targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</li>
        <li>To 1:09:30</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How it goes 'in actuality'</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Node - a single instance of a decentralised network which anyone can join.</li>
        <li>Ethereum can carry out computations for mining - Concensus - Proof of stake, Proof of work, </li>
        <li>Consensus protocol has 1- Chain selection, 2- Sybil resistance mechanism</li>
        <li>To 1:13:23 SybilControl mechanism consists of a distributed protocol to allow nodes to 
            collectively verify the computational work of other nodes, and mechanisms to prevent the 
            malicious influence of misbehaving nodes that do not perform the computational work.</li>
    </ul>        
    <h4>Proof of Work</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>PoW verifies the transaction node and the transaction (the Nonce) and is an SRM. The length of the 
            mining algorithm can vary in length which affects the complexity of the computation 
            (Block Time).
            Each malicious node has to be mined and will (can) be eliminated.</li>
        <li>To find the real node/transaction we use a Chain Selection Rule called Chain, or Nakamoto,
             Consensus which combines PoW and longest chain.</li>
        <li>The first node to solve the Nonce earns the Transaction fee (the Gas) and the Block award</li>
        <li>Attacks. Sybil or 51% (can happen on Etherum Classic but not Etherum?)</li>
        <li>Longest chain rule</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Proof of Stake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>PoStake - gas paid to validators, discussed later</li>
        <li>PoW uses lots of electricity. PoStake is the most popular alternative verification and many
            newcomers incorporate PoS including in ETH 2.0</li>
        <li>PoS miners are called validators, they are chosen randomly they and all remaining validatores 
            put up collateral as non-Sybil attack garauntee </li>
        <li>Randomness in a determinist system which by def does not have random numbers, can be generated
            through EG in ETH2 by RANDAO, a decentralised, autonomous organisation using a smart contract 
            in the blockchain.</li>
        <li>PoS pros - civil resistance mechanism, reveals block author, less computation therefore power usage
            through PoS decentralisation. Further use will determine how much decentralisation will PoS need.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scaleability</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A high numbers of users results in higher 'gas' charges.</li>
        <li>Can be alleviated by 'sharding' - a block chain of block chains which co-ordinates the higher number
            of users by Layers.</li>
        <li>Layer 1 (baselayer) - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche. Layer 2 is an application added on top of L1.
            EG Chainlink, Arbitrum, Optimism. A & O are known as 'roll-ups' which r/up into Layer 1 using 
            Layer 1 security and act like a sharded chain.</li>
        <li>Ahhh... Side Chains. Derive security from their own protocols</li>
        <li>Find link for further descriptions of Sharding</li>
    </ul>
